# We are first going to go over how to run a backwards stepwise regression to eliminate unneccessary variables. 
# BACKWARDS REGRESSION 

# Fit a linear model
lm_model <- lm(response ~ ., data = your_data)

# Perform backward selection
backward_model <- step(lm_model, direction = "backward")

# View the summary of the final model
summary(backward_model)
