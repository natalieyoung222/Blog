# We are first going to go over how to run a backwards stepwise regression to eliminate unneccessary variables. 
# BACKWARDS REGRESSION 

# Fit a linear model
lm_model <- lm(response ~ ., data = your_data)

# Perform backward selection
backward_model <- step(lm_model, direction = "backward")

# View the summary of the final model
summary(backward_model)
## The step() function automatically performs backward selection, eliminating variables based on the AIC criterion. The resulting backward_model will contain the final model after the elimination process.

# We will now run a random forest model excluding the eliminated variables from the backwards regression model. 
#RANDOM FOREST 

# Extract the names of eliminated variables from the backward model
eliminated_vars <- setdiff(names(lm_model$coefficients), names(backward_model$coefficients))

# Remove eliminated variables from the dataset
data_rf <- your_data[, -which(names(your_data) %in% eliminated_vars)]

# Split the data into training and testing sets
set.seed(123)
train_indices_rf <- sample(1:nrow(data_rf), 0.7 * nrow(data_rf))
train_data_rf <- data_rf[train_indices_rf, ]
test_data_rf <- data_rf[-train_indices_rf, ]

# Train the random forest model
rf_model <- randomForest(response ~ ., data = train_data_rf, ntree = 500)

# Make predictions on the test data
predictions_rf <- predict(rf_model, newdata = test_data_rf)

# Evaluate the model
confusion_matrix_rf <- table(predictions_rf, test_data_rf$response)
accuracy_rf <- sum(diag(confusion_matrix_rf)) / sum(confusion_matrix_rf)

# View the variable importance
var_importance <- importance(rf_model)
print(var_importance)

# This code first identifies the eliminated variables from the backward linear regression model and then removes those variables from the dataset. After that, it proceeds to train a random forest model with the modified dataset and evaluates its performance.
# Make sure to replace 'response' with the actual name of your response variable and adjust the code according to your specific dataset structure and column names.
